# Motivation and Objectives

`webr` allows you to run R directly in your web browser, making it particularly valuable for teaching. Instructors can demonstrate R code seamlessly within their lecture notes, eliminating the need to switch between slides and RStudio. Students can also work on exercises within the lecture slides, focusing entirely on problem-solving without concerns about having the correct R objects or packages installed on their local machines^[However, it’s important to note that having students work on their own computers offers value, as setting up their environment, including installing packages, is an essential part of the learning process.].

While you can use datasets that are part of an R package easily on an `webr` session, you would need to take extra steps to use external datasets like your own datasets (see [here](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/qwebr-loading-data.html)). The goal of this blog post is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up R data packages on R-universe to use external datasets for the `webr` sessions in documents created by Quarto.

Those who would like to use your own datasets in `webr` sessions.

:::{.callout-important title="Pre-requisites"}
In this blog post, I assume you are comfortable with version control with git and Github. However, no prior experience in creating an R package is necessary. Indeed, those who have never built an R package benefits the most from this blog post.

# Steps

Here are the major steps to take before you can use external datasets in `webr` sessions, with each of the steps consisting of smaller tasks.

1. Create an R data package
2. Host the package on R-universe
3. Install the package on `webr` sessions inside a Quarto document

## Prepare an R data package

In this section, we introduce a method for creating an R dataset package—one that includes only datasets, similar to the `nycflights13` package. The aim is not to create a CRAN-approvable package but rather to develop a minimal viable R package that can be used in `webr` sessions.

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tmieno2/r-data-package-template) to your local computer. This repository is a modified version of the RStudio project when you initiate a new RStudio project for an R package by navigate through **New Project...** -> **New Directory** -> **R Package** on RStudio. Here are the modifications:

+ **hello.R** in the **R** folder and **hello.Rd** in the **man** are removed
+ *data.R* is added in the **R** folder
+ **data-raw** folder is created, and then **gen_data.qmd** and **sample_data.csv** are created inside it
+ **dev** folder is created, and then **dev.qmd** is created inside it
+ `^data-raw$` and `^dev$` are added to **.Rbuildignore**

2. Open the cloned folder in RStudio, locate and open **dev.qmd**, and follow the instructions. These will guide you through:

+	Creating datasets for the data package
+	Writing descriptions for the datasets
+	Generating documentation of the dataset
+	Verifying that the datasets are accessible after the package is installed

By the end, you will have a functional R data package.

As long as you follow the instructions, you should be able to clear the CRAN check (though it is not necessary as we are not submitting this package to CRAN):

3. Create a new repository on Github for this package and push the project folder to your Github account.

## Set up R-universe

I basically follow the instruction provided [here](https://docs.r-universe.dev/publish/set-up.html) to set up one's own universe, but with some visual aids. 

1. Create a Github repository named `your-username.r-unievrse.dev`. For me this would be `tmieno2.r-unievrse.dev` as my Github account name is `tmieno2`. 

![](r-universe-dev){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

2. Clone the repository and create a file called **packages.json**. Inside the file, you specify the name of the package and the url of the Github repository that hosts the package like below:

```default
[
  {
    "package": "package name 1",
    "url": "ulr of the Github repository 1"
  },
  {
    "package": "package name 2",
    "url": "ulr of the Github repository 2"
  },
]
```

In my case, it looks like below:

![](package-json){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

I have only one package on R-universe called **r.spatial.workshop.datasets**, which is hosted at **https://github.com/tmieno2/r.spatial.workshop.datasets.git**.

3. Install the r-universe app on your Github account by clicking on [here](https://github.com/apps/r-universe/installations/new). 

4. Wait until your package is built and hosted at your r-universe page **https://your-username.r-universe.dev** (e.g., https://tmieno2.r-universe.dev for me). Click on the little green check mark next to the most recent commit message and you will see a green check mark to the r-universe icon when the package is done building like below.

## Install the package on `webr` sessions inside a Quarto document

Now that the data package is on R-universe, you can easily use it in your `webr` sessions. I am currently using [quarto-webr](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension (see [here](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation and [here](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for how use use it in a Quarto document).

Please note that, each time a document with `webr` session is opened, a data package needs to be installed to use its datasets. This can be easily done by including a code like below at the beginning of the qmd file.

````default
```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
install.packages(
  "package name", 
  repos = "https://your-account-name.r-universe.dev"
)

data(dataset-name)
```
````

For example, the following code will install the `r.spatial.workshop.datasets` package and load `NIR` dataset. `#| context: setup` is used her because users do not have to see the code. But, of course, you can show the codes as well if you wish.

````default
```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
install.packages(
  "r.spatial.workshop.datasets", 
  repos = "https://tmieno2.r-universe.dev"
)

data(NIR)
```
````

If you want to see this in action, you can visit [here](https://github.com/tmieno2/R-as-GIS-workshop) and you can look at lines 84-96 of **L01_vector_basics.qmd**.
