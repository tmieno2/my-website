These will guide you through:\n\n\nCreating datasets for the data package\nWriting descriptions for the datasets\nGenerating documentation of the dataset\nVerifying that the datasets are accessible after the package is installed\n\nBy the end, you will have a functional R data package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs long as you follow the instructions, you should be able to clear the CRAN check (though it is not necessary as we are not submitting this package to CRAN):\n\n\n\nCreate a new repository on Github for this package and push the project folder to your Github account."

    "text": "image taken by Oregon Department of Forestry\n\n\n\nBackground and project overview\nIn many parts of U.S. agricultural production is heavily reliant on irrigation. Years of massive groundwater pumping has led to severe aquifer depletion. One of the promising means to tackle this problem is biochar. Biochar is produced through a process called pyrolysis, which involves the thermal decomposition of organic material in the absence or near-absence of oxygen. Applying biochar to production fields has a number of benefits to soil health.\nThe overarching goal of this project is to assess the impact of biochar application on the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and assess its economic viability. I am in charge of conducting economic analysis of biochar adoption and application.\n\n\nKey Research Topics\n\nEconomic evaluation of biochar application: does it really pay?\nWhat are the physical and chemical impacts of biochar application to fields?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview\nThis project conducts on-farm input experiments (e.g., fertilizer, seed) across the U.S. (primarily in the Midwest) and in other countries (e.g., South Africa, Argentina). We analyze the data and generate input use recommendations for the owners of the experimental fields. Additionally, this project develops cyber-infrastructure to design and conduct on-farm randomized agricultural input trials, analyze the data, and produce actionable input management reports.\n\n\nKey Research Topics\n\nEconomic evaluation of various trial designs\nEvaluation of statistical methods to estimate site-specific yield response functions\nEconomic evaluation of on-farm trials\n\n\n\nRelevant Publications\n\n\n   \n    \n    \n      Order By\n      Default\n      \n        Title\n      \n      \n        Year\n      \n      \n        Journal\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nJournal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nQuadratic-plateau geographically weighted regression model for estimating site-specific economically optimal input rates (Paper)\n\n\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nSite-specific drivers of sensor-based nitrogen management in on-farm corn and wheat experiments (Paper)\n\n\nFrontiers in Agronomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nCan machine learning models provide accurate fertilizer recommendations?
