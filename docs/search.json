Instructors can demonstrate R code seamlessly within their lecture notes, eliminating the need to switch between slides and RStudio. Students can also work on exercises within the lecture slides, focusing entirely on problem-solving without concerns about having the correct R objects or packages installed on their local machines1.\nWhile you can use datasets that are part of an R package easily on an webr session, you would need to take extra steps to use external datasets like your own datasets (see here). The goal of this blog post is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up R data packages on R-universe to use external datasets for the webr sessions in documents created by Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\nThose who would like to use your own datasets in webr sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, I assume you are comfortable with version control with git and Github.

The aim is not to create a CRAN-approvable package but rather to develop a minimal viable R package that can be used in webr sessions.\n\nClone this repository to your local computer. This repository is a modified version of the RStudio project when you initiate a new RStudio project for an R package by navigate through New Project… -&gt; New Directory -&gt; R Package on RStudio. Here are the modifications:\n\n\nhello.R in the R folder and hello.Rd in the man are removed\ndata.R is added in the R folder\ndata-raw folder is created, and then gen_data.qmd and sample_data.csv are created inside it\ndev folder is created, and then dev.qmd is created inside it\n^data-raw$ and ^dev$ are added to .Rbuildignore\n\n\nOpen the cloned folder in RStudio, locate and open dev.qmd, and follow the instructions. These will guide you through:\n\n\nCreating datasets for the data package\nWriting descriptions for the datasets\nGenerating documentation of the dataset\nVerifying that the datasets are accessible after the package is installed\n\nBy the end, you will have a functional R data package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs long as you follow the instructions, you should be able to clear the CRAN check (though it is not necessary as we are not submitting this package to CRAN):\n\n\n\nCreate a new repository on Github for this package and push the project folder to your Github account."

    "text": "image taken by Oregon Department of Forestry\n\n\n\nBackground and project overview\nIn many parts of U.S. agricultural production is heavily reliant on irrigation. Years of massive groundwater pumping has led to severe aquifer depletion. One of the promising means to tackle this problem is biochar. Biochar is produced through a process called pyrolysis, which involves the thermal decomposition of organic material in the absence or near-absence of oxygen. Applying biochar to production fields has a number of benefits to soil health.\nThe overarching goal of this project is to assess the impact of biochar application on the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and assess its economic viability. I am in charge of conducting economic analysis of biochar adoption and application.\n\n\nKey Research Topics\n\nEconomic evaluation of biochar application: does it really pay?\nWhat are the physical and chemical impacts of biochar application to fields?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
